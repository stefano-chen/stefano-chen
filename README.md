# About Me
----
I'm a second year Masterâ€™s Degree student in Computer Engineering at the University of Trieste with 
a strong interest in software engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. Driven by 
intellectual curiosity and a genuine passion for learning, I aim to explore new concepts and tackle 
unfamiliar challenges. My adaptability and intrinsic motivation allow me to quickly grasp complex 
ideas. I'm excited to apply and expand my skills through hands-on experience in real-world projects. 
My complete portfolio of personal and academic projects is available on my GitHub profile.
